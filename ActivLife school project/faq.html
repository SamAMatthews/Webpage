        <p class="h1"><b>Frequently Asked Questions</b></p>

        <p class="s1">1. Why is this website so janky?</p>
        <p class="p1">Good question! This entire webpage is currently being held together solely by a mix of code from my existing website, stuff from various web dev forums, most of which I don't understand, and enough dark internet magic to kill a small town of real web developers. In all honesty, I do not understand a single line of the JavaScript program that this site uses to hide the navbar when you scroll down. I don't know how it works at all. Heck, it could be summoning some little green goblin from deep within the W3Schools webservers for all I know- I don't have a clue! In fact, I pray to the internet gods every night that this dumpster fire of a website remains functional when I wake up the next day! At one point, I even considered making a blood sacrifice to The Great CSSus (the god of CSS) when I was struggling to get this content box to work, but luckily it started working as I had hoped before that became necessary.</p>
        <p class="p1">TL;DR, this site is held together almost exclusively by wishful thinking, and oh boy does it show.</p>

        <p class="s1">2. Why SpeedFit?</p>
        <p class="p1">Because we are better. Frankly, SpeedFit is compatible with a much wider range of platforms than its competition, such as alternative products from Apple, Samsung, etc. (according to Legal, I can't be any more specific about competing brands than this ü§ì, blah blah blah, insert "literally 1984" comment here, you get it). Sure, these alternatives have better features and optimisations for their intended ecosystem (I can assure you that Legal is currently fuming in their overpriced designer suits right now), however they lock you into said ecosystems, and are a far less personal experience for you, the user, than SpeedFit. SpeedFit can provide you with fitness appraisals made specifically for you by one of our expert fitness coaches, from the comfort of your own home, and even in-person if you so desire. We also won't lock you into our own ecosystem of devices- SpeedFit is compatible with almost every mainstream platform, and even Linux! Surely that's enough to convince you that SpeedFit is a way more user-friendly platform than the competition from Samsung, Apple, Google, and the likes (cry about it, John from Legal)!</p>

        <p class="s1">3. What are your values?</p>
        <p class="p1">We here at ActivLife hold a lot of values dearly. Some of the most important of these values are our focus on a personal experience for all our customers, the protection of our customer's privacy (an especially important value for a health-focused company), and probably most important of all, our love of money. Oh, the lengths we go to for the sweet smell of a bundle of cash. I can assure you, there is nothing more feared by Finance than Henry from the IRS (eat your heart out, John from Legal). You would not believe the deafening silence that sweeps over that department when Henry arrives. I'm telling you, when that man walks in, our building's 13th floor becomes so filled with existential dread that there is not a single window on that level that isn't covered in sweaty condensation. Everybody fears Henry. Not that we have anything to hide. Our company is completely honest about its taxable income. We would never transfer $5 million USD into an offshore investment in Cuba, in the form of a 2000 square metre, 3-floor mansion and private jet. Why would we ever do that? I assure you, we would never commit tax fraud. Ever. I promise.</p>

        <p class="s1">4. What motivated you to create SpeedFit?</p>
        <p class="p1">An innate desire to make obscene amounts of money. Pretty simple, really.</p>
